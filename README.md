# The VBA of Wall Street - Stock market analysis

- - -

I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

- - -

* I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and outputted the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  * Used conditional formatting that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.
